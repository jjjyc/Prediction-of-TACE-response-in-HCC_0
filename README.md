# Real-time automatic prediction of treatment response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma using deep learning based on digital subtraction angiography videos

# Abstract 
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the mainstay of therapy for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); yet its efficacy varies between patients with the same tumor stage. Accurate prediction of TACE response remains a major concern to avoid overtreatment. Thus, we aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence system for real-time automatic prediction of TACE response in HCC patients based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) videos via a deep learning approach.

# Codes
Directory "DSA_LTD" is the segmentation network (Model 1) to segment tumors. 

Directory "Prediction" is the treatment response prediction network (Model 2). 

# Models 
There are the best models we have trained for the 2 models in 'models.zip'.

# Enviroment 
Use anaconda3 to run "conda env create -f ./conda_env.yml".
